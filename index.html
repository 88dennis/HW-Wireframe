### Helpful Hints

* For a refresher on working with Git and GitHub, consult the GitHub Supplemental Guide we sent you in class.
* Don't forget to review these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.
* This will be a tough assignment. Towards the end of the course, you'll look back to this exercise and realize just how much you've grown as a developer. Stay positive!
